Sales Pro - Advanced Sales & Stock Dashboard
This is a comprehensive, client-side web application for managing product inventory, logging sales across multiple shops, and generating sales reports. All data is saved locally in your browser's storage, meaning no database or backend is required.
Features
Multi-Shop Inventory: Track stock counts for each product across different shop locations (e.g., "MM Mobiles" and "Max").
Live Barcode Scanning: Use your device's camera to scan product barcodes for quick and accurate data entry.
Month-wise & All-Time Sales: View and manage sales logs organized by month, or see a complete history of all transactions.
Sales Reports: Generate simple reports with key metrics for any given month.
Excel Export: Export your monthly or all-time sales data to an .xlsx file with one click.
Local Data Persistence: All your product and sales data is automatically saved in the browser, so it persists even after closing the tab.
